# Riemann_Integral
In the branch of mathematics known as real analysis, the Riemann integral, created by Bernhard Riemann, was the first rigorous definition of the integral of a function on an interval. For many functions and practical applications, the Riemann integral can be evaluated by the fundamental theorem of calculus or approximated by numerical integration. A bounded function on a compact interval [a, b] is Riemann integrable if and only if it is continuous almost everywhere. In its geometrical interpretation on the plane, the integral is the operator assigning a given real bounded function defined on the (real) interval to a real number, which can be understood as the area between its plot and the axis of abscissa. The main advantages of the Riemann integral are intuitiveness, clarity of definition and relative ease of introduction, often enough for most practical applications.
